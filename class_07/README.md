# Exercises
1. Write all programs in the slides and feed them into the CafeOBJ system. Moreover, write some more test code and do some more testing for the programs.
2. Revise the simulator (including the version in which the Mutex property is checked) so that it can deal with the case in which there are four threads.
3. Make comparison of the simulator implemented in this lecture with the one implemented in the last lecture and describe the pros and cons of each implementation.
